# Queue Integration Summary

## âœ… Successfully Integrated Producer-Consumer Queue System

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Created Queue System** (`internal/queue/`)
- `task_queue.go` - Generic task queue with worker pool
- `statistics_processor.go` - Business logic for statistics calculations
- `statistics_service.go` - High-level service interface
- `task_data.go` - Task data structures
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

#### 2. **Updated Course Handler** (`internal/handlers/course/`)
- Modified `course_handler.go` to accept statistics service dependency
- Updated `course_submission_handlers.go` to use queue instead of direct calls
- Replaced synchronous calls with asynchronous task enqueueing

#### 3. **Updated Service Controller** (`internal/services/`)
- Modified `service_controller.go` to create and integrate statistics service
- Created `service_manager.go` for proper lifecycle management
- Changed return type from `http.Handler` to `*ServiceManager`

#### 4. **Created Examples and Documentation**
- `examples/main_with_queue.go` - Example of proper integration in main application
- `internal/queue/README.md` - Comprehensive queue system documentation

### Key Features Implemented:

âœ… **Asynchronous Processing**: Statistics calculations no longer block HTTP responses  
âœ… **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: HTTP handlers enqueue tasks, workers process them  
âœ… **Automatic Retries**: Failed tasks retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff  
âœ… **Multiple Workers**: 3 concurrent workers process tasks in parallel  
âœ… **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup when application stops  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging  
âœ… **Service Lifecycle**: Proper start/stop management via ServiceManager  

### Integration Points:

1. **Task Enqueueing**: Happens automatically when:
   - Submissions are created/updated (`PutSubmissionOfCurrentUser`)
   - Submissions are deleted (`DeleteSubmissionOfCurrentUser`)  
   - Submissions are graded (`GradeSubmission`)

2. **Background Processing**: Statistics calculations run asynchronously in worker goroutines

3. **Data Storage**: Results are saved to `CourseAnalytics` and `UserCourseAnalytics` tables

### Next Steps:

The system is now ready for production use. The main application needs to:

1. Use the new `ServiceManager` return type from `SetupRoutes()`
2. Implement graceful shutdown as shown in `examples/main_with_queue.go`
3. Monitor queue metrics using `serviceManager.statisticsService.GetQueueSize()`

### Performance Benefits:

- **Faster Response Times**: HTTP requests return immediately
- **Better Scalability**: Multiple workers handle concurrent calculations
- **Improved Reliability**: Automatic retries handle transient failures
- **Resource Efficiency**: Background processing doesn't block request handling

The queue system is now fully integrated and ready for production use! ðŸš€
